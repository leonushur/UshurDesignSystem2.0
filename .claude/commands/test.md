# Component Testing

Delegate to the storybook-tester for comprehensive testing:

```
@storybook-tester Test the component: $ARGUMENTS. Verify visual rendering, interactions, accessibility, and compare against design specifications.
```

Testing includes:
- Visual verification of all variants
- Interaction testing (click, hover, focus)
- Accessibility audit (keyboard nav, screen readers, contrast)
- Responsive behavior checks
