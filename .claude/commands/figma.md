# Figma to Code Implementation

Delegate to the figma-implementer for design translation:

```
@figma-implementer Convert the Figma design at $ARGUMENTS to a React component using the project's design tokens. Map all Figma values to semantic tokens.
```

After implementation, recommend:
1. @storybook-creator for comprehensive stories
2. @design-system-auditor for token compliance verification
