<Description>
    The application table kit showcases all of the layouts, states, and interaction patterns our product teams need:
    rich headers with bulk actions, alternating fills, divider treatments, and empty/error scaffolding. Use these stories
    as the canonical reference when composing data-heavy surfaces inside console experiences.
</Description>

## Core Layouts

The base table establishes our density, padding, and interaction tokens. Use the `size` prop to switch between the roomy
default and the compact variant shown below.

<Canvas>
    <Story of={TableStories.Default} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
    <Story of={TableStories.SmallSize} />
</Canvas>

## Divider Treatments

Divider-based layouts are ideal for files, invoices, and transactional feeds where scannability matters more than bulk
selection. Each story demonstrates a different header composition (filters, dropdowns, uploads).

<Canvas>
    <Story of={TableStories.DividerLine01} />
</Canvas>
<Canvas>
    <Story of={TableStories.DividerLine02} />
</Canvas>
<Canvas>
    <Story of={TableStories.DividerLine03} />
</Canvas>
<Canvas>
    <Story of={TableStories.DividerLine04} />
</Canvas>

## Alternating Fills

Use alternating fills when you need visual rhythm without heavy dividers. Switch between row- and column-based emphasis
to match the data orientation.

<Canvas>
    <Story of={TableStories.AlternatingFills01} />
</Canvas>
<Canvas>
    <Story of={TableStories.AlternatingFills02} />
</Canvas>
<Canvas>
    <Story of={TableStories.AlternatingFills03} />
</Canvas>
<Canvas>
    <Story of={TableStories.AlternatingFills04} />
</Canvas>

## Empty & Error States

Pair tables with purposeful fallbacks so users always know what to do next—whether that's starting a new upload,
onboarding vendors, or retrying after a failure.

<Canvas>
    <Story of={TableStories.NoVendorsFound} />
</Canvas>
<Canvas>
    <Story of={TableStories.StartByUploadingFile} />
</Canvas>
<Canvas>
    <Story of={TableStories.TableErrorState} />
</Canvas>
